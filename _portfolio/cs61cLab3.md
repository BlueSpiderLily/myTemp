Disclaimer: The content presented here reflects my understanding of materials from UC Berkeley's CS61C course "Great Ideas of Computer Architecture (Machine Structures)" Lab 3, and while it includes my own contributions, it is not entirely my original work.

For this project I plan to prepare working with RISC-V assembly and debugging tools such as Venus. Here's a summary of the steps and key concepts covered:
# Setup:
For this project I cloned into the git repository using GIT Bash.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/61c-teach/fa24-lab-starter.git
```

Thereafter, I installed tools necessary for this lab using the command:

```bash
$ bash tools/download_tools.sh
```

Also I did need to install the latest version of java.

And with that, my machine was practically ready.

# Exercise 1: Venus Basics
We use Venus so that any changes made on our local machine can replicate themselves to Venus web's frontend and vice versa.

In my cloned project labs folder I needed to expose my projects directory by using an open port and the command:

```bash
$ java -jar tools/venus.jar . -dm
```

![javalinLogo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlueSpiderLily/myTemp/refs/heads/master/images/risc/riscv1.PNG)

Now if I open Venus on my local web browser, I can now see the web terminal and we can mount our local machines project folder to this website. This way if we apply any changes in either place, the changes will replicate respectively.

We can do this by performing the command in our Venus terminal:

```bash
$ mount local labs
```

![](https://github.com/BlueSpiderLily/myTemp/blob/master/images/risc/riscv2.PNG)

As we can see it asks for an authentication key which we can see in our local machines terminal. Successfully providing this key to Venus will then link our files like we wish.

Navigating to our files tab, we can now see the success.

Now we're ready to really get to the fun!

# Exercise 2: Venus Basics

In this exercise we're asked to answer all eleven questions.
We will do so here,

### Walkthrough Exercise 2:

First though, we must open the respective file, "fib.s" in our project folder.
  + Question 1: What is the machine code of the highlighted instruction? The answer should be a 32 bit hexadecimal number, with the 0x prefix.
  ![](https://github.com/BlueSpiderLily/myTemp/blob/master/images/risc/riscv4.PNG)
  >0x000002B3

  + Question 2: What is the machine code of the instruction at address 0x34? The answer should be a 32 bit hexadecimal number, with the 0x prefix.
  ![](https://github.com/BlueSpiderLily/myTemp/blob/master/images/risc/riscv5.PNG)
  >0x00000073

On the right side of our screen we also have a "registers" tab, which we can use to see all 32 bit registers.
  + Question 3: What is the value of the sp register? The answer should be a 32 bit hexadecimal number, with the 0x prefix.
  ![](https://github.com/BlueSpiderLily/myTemp/blob/master/images/risc/riscv6.PNG)
  >0x7FFFFFE0

We're asked to continue stepping until the value in the register 't1' changes. Our initial value is:
  ![](https://github.com/BlueSpiderLily/myTemp/blob/master/images/risc/riscv7.PNG)
  >0x00000000

At offset 0x8 we see the change:
  + Question 4: What is the new value of the t1 register? The answer should be a 32 bit hexadecimal number, with the 0x prefix.
  ![](https://github.com/BlueSpiderLily/myTemp/blob/master/images/risc/riscv8.PNG)
  >0x00000001

It's also asking for the machine code of the current instruction:
  + Question 5: What is the machine code of the current instruction? The answer should be a 32 bit hexadecimal number, with the 0x prefix.
  ![](https://github.com/BlueSpiderLily/myTemp/blob/master/images/risc/riscv9.PNG)
  >0x10000E17

Stepping until offset 0x10, we're then asked:
  + Question 6: What is the value of the t3 register? The answer should be a 32 bit hexadecimal number, with the 0x prefix.
  ![](https://github.com/BlueSpiderLily/myTemp/blob/master/images/risc/riscv10.PNG)
  >0x10000000

We're also asked what it points to, and we can see this instruction says "lw x28 0(x28)", the 0(x28) is key to me showing a dereference of an address. So lets take its address and find what it points to.
  + Question 7: What is the byte that t3 points to? The answer should be an 8 bit (1 byte) hexadecimal number, with the 0x prefix.
  ![](https://github.com/BlueSpiderLily/myTemp/blob/master/images/risc/riscv11.PNG)
  >0C

Next, we're asked to set a breakpoint on offset 0x28, and find the value in the t0 register.
  + Question 8: What is the value of the t0 register? The answer should be a 32 bit hexadecimal number, with the 0x prefix.
  ![](https://github.com/BlueSpiderLily/myTemp/blob/master/images/risc/riscv12.PNG)
  >0x00000001

Stepping into the loops breakpoint six more times like asked, we need to find the new value of the t0 register.
  + Question 8: What is the value of the t0 register? The answer should be a 32 bit hexadecimal number, with the 0x prefix.
  ![](https://github.com/BlueSpiderLily/myTemp/blob/master/images/risc/riscv13.PNG)
  >0x0000000D

Now we're asked to change from hexadecimal and read the decimal value:
  + Question 10: What is the value of the t0 register in decimal? The answer should be a decimal number without a prefix.
  ![](https://github.com/BlueSpiderLily/myTemp/blob/master/images/risc/riscv14.PNG)
  >13

Running the program until it finishes we're lastly asked:
  + Question 11: What is the output of the program? The answer should be a decimal number without a prefix.
  ![](https://github.com/BlueSpiderLily/myTemp/blob/master/images/risc/riscv15.PNG)
  >144

# Exercise 3: Using Memcheck

In this exercise we're asked to answer seven new questions for exercise 3, using memcheck.

What is memcheck? These are basically two different modes for debugging our assembly level programs.
>Normal mode: shows our invalid reads or writes to memory, if there is unfreed memory at the end of the program it will notify us of this size.
>Verbose mode: this also prints out invalid reads and writes to memory, however it now includes a list of blocks of memory not freed upon finishing the program.

We will answer the questions again, here.

First things first, we need to open ex3_memcheck.s in our Venus online editor and get a general idea of it's behavior.
After running the program, it looks like we're running into an error message, and asked to:
  + Question 1: What address did the program try to access, but caused the error? The answer should be a 32 bit hexadecimal number, with the 0x prefix.
  ![](https://github.com/BlueSpiderLily/myTemp/blob/master/images/risc/riscv16.PNG)
  >0x10008058

We're also asked:
  + Question 2: How many bytes was the program trying to access? The answer should be a decimal number without a prefix.
  >4 bytes

Seeming like a memory error, we go ahead and turn on memcheck in Venus editor to get more details.
  + Question 3: What address did the program try to access, but caused the error? The answer should be a 32 bit hexadecimal number, with the 0x prefix.
  ![](https://github.com/BlueSpiderLily/myTemp/blob/master/images/risc/riscv17.PNG)
  >0x10008080

  + Question 4: How many bytes were allocated in the block related to the error? The answer should be a number without units.
  >40

  + Question 5: Which line of the source file caused this error? The answer should be a number.
  >Line 18

Trying to debug this error and recalling that register t1 contains the loop counter we're asked:
  + Question 6: What is the value of t1 based on the memcheck error message? The answer should be a decimal number.
  ![](https://github.com/BlueSpiderLily/myTemp/blob/master/images/risc/riscv18.PNG)
  >11

We're asked to fix this error in the source code, and we know it was on line 18 so, lets try and find the bad actor:

# Exercise 4: Array Practice

If we consider the discrete value function on integers in set {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}. With the function definition:
```
f(-3) = 6
f(-2) = 61
f(-1) = 17
f(0) = -38
f(1) = 19
f(2) = 42
f(3) = 5
```

We can implement a function 'f:' such that all output values stored in the output array go through register a1, AND we can index into ths array and get the correct associated output.

Explanation:
>The thought process is added in comments in the code snippets but essentially we added an immediate value 3 to the register a0 which holds our index to get to the correct starting point and stored it in a temp register t0. Then to multiply by 4 (size of a word) we can shift the bits left two times which gives us a multiplication of 2^2 so 4, and store this value t1. This is what we'll add every time to register a1 (our base address for the values) to get to the next element. Then we load the element into memory so we can print it. This is essentially what we did here.

Explanation:
>Essentially, this exercise tailored me to learn about a base case, if n = 0 we just return 1. Otherwise we needed to create a loop in risc-v to continiously multiply n by (n-1) by (n-2) until our n reached zero, breaking out of the loop; giving us n!. Again, each of my thought processes are again explained in the comments of the code.

Testing 8!
